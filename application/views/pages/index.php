						<h4 class="intro">Welcome</h4>
						<p>
								I'm a front end developer, cook, musician &amp; amateur brewer of beer and kombucha.
								I live in Cambridge, MA. and when not pursuing these ventures I enjoy cycling, reading, traveling, kickboxing and laughing at anything funny.
						</p>
						<p>
								I work at <a href="http://www.nutraclick.com" target="_blank"><strong>NutraClick</strong></a> as a front end developer tackling things small, large and extraordinary.  
								The challenges encountered so far have strengthened my skills and solidified my commitment to becoming the most well rounded developer I can be.  
								I've worked for a web development and design company located in New York - <a href="http://www.zooluweb.com" title="website design shop"><strong>Zoolu Web Solutions</strong></a>
								as well as a financial consulting firm <a href="http://www.truebridge.com"><strong>Truebridge</strong></a> expanding on a browser based CRM.
								These jobs complemented my learning while completing my CS degree from BU and playing as much music as I could.
						</p>
						<p>
								Most of my development is focused on delivering web applications using PHP, JS, SQL, HTML &amp; CSS.  In school and with any new jobs or ventures I always enjoying learning new
								languages, concepts, technologies, and design patterns.<br />
